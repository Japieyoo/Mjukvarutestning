In the patience (single player card game) 1-2-3 you take one card at a time from the deck at the same time as you are counting 1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,3 etc. 
You lose the game as soon as you get a card with the value 1, when counting "one", or a card with value 2, when counting "two", or a card with value 3, when counting "three".
